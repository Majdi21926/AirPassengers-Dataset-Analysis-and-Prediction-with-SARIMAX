# AirPassengers-Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction-with-SARIMAX

This repository presents a time series analysis and forecasting of the AirPassengers dataset using the SARIMAX model. The project includes:

1. Loading necessary libraries
2. Reading and exploring the dataset
3. Aggregating data by month and visualizing the entire series (using Bokeh)
4. Stationarity testing
5. First-order and second-order differencing
6. Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis
7. Splitting data into training and test sets
8. Building and evaluating the SARIMAX model

This project aims to analyze trends, seasonality, and forecast future air passenger traffic using SARIMAX. 📈✈️
